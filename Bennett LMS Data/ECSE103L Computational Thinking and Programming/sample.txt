Python is relatively simple,
so it's easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on readability.
Developers can read and translate Python code much easier than other languages.
In turn, this reduces the cost of program maintenance and development because,
it allows teams to work collaboratively without significant language and experience barriers.
